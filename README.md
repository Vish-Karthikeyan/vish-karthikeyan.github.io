Hello, I am Viswajeeth (Vish) Karthikeyan. My name literally means “conqueror of the universe” in Sanskrit (विश्वजित्), but so far the only thing I have conquered (with significant collateral damage) is a solid foundation in computer science, economics and political science at one of the world’s leading universities. 

I’m officially a CS major on the theory track (yes, we exist) with a minor in Public Policy, but my interests broadly include statistical learning, natural language processing, complexity theory, public decision-making, constructive dialogue, and education. You can look at my current research work here, and my teaching here. 

I grew up in Erode, India, in the southernmost state of Tamil Nadu surrounded by textile looms, vibrant paddy fields and a community shaped by diligence and ambition. At Stanford, I am a part of the Stanford Political Union’s leadership team—THE club for fostering non-partisan, constructive dialogue on campus that goes as far as 1953. You might also find me at the Bridge Peer Counseling Center, Stanford's student-run peer counseling service open 24/7 for calls and walk-ins! Or maybe you ended up on this page after you saw my work on the Stanford Review.

Lately, I’ve cultivated an alarming curiosity for Spanish, often amidst my shenanigans as a student worker at Arrillaga Family Dining Commons. (I’m sorry, I truly don’t get to decide what’s on the menu.) Por favor, ponte en contacto conmigo si te gustaría viajar a España conmigo durante las próximas vacaciones de invierno.
