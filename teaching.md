**EDUC 193A (Fall ‘25, Winter ‘26)**

Amidst a surge in institutional disillusionment, pathological uncertainty and existential dread across the world, unmet mental health needs remain at an all time high. At [the Bridge Peer Counseling Center](https://web.stanford.edu/group/bridge/), we strive to do best what friends can do—listen. When traditional mental health resources fail to meet the moment for whatever reason, peer counseling offers something fundamentally different—the simple yet profound act of being heard by another human being. 

Stanford students from all disciplines and years take EDUC 193A: the first class in a series of two that trains them to be effective peer counselors and to make the Bridge available 24/7 to the entire community. One of the most meaningful aspects of serving as a section leader was supporting students as they learned to hold real vulnerability. However, the most rewarding moment was not when a section went carefully as planned beforehand, but when I met them as fellow staffers at our first all-staff meeting of the quarter! 

This is now my second quarter teaching this class. I am looking forward to continuing to be a part of this wonderful community and contributing in more ways the following year.

**UAR 101F and UAR 101V (Fall ‘24)**

Your first few months away from home, surrounded by [squirrels that defy biology](https://www.instagram.com/stanfordsquirrels/), LinkedIn connection-maxxers, and a diet rich in microplastics can be understatedly debilitating. Frosh is a 1-unit discussion seminar for freshmen taken in their first quarter at Stanford where they are trained to understand, navigate and appreciate the ups and downs that together make up the collegiate environment. 

As Frosh 101 section leaders, equipped with training on inclusive teaching practices and the impact of mental health, diversity, inclusion and a sense of belonging on learning and thriving, we foster a community that comes together every week to normalize the disorienting, celebrate the awkward, and make space for the real. Frosh 101 feels like an extension of New Student Orientation that every freshman must be a part of. 

I lead two sections—one each in Crothers and Lantana. I still see these students around campus, and every single time, it makes me smile knowing I got to be a part of their beginnings here.
